            <h2>Website 1: Breath of the Wild Compendium</h2>
            <p>Using public API and Streamlit in CS 1301, I was able to make a useful website that displays weapons, items, etc.
            and tell stats about them in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I included 3 search features: by
            name, by item number, or randomly by category.

            <h2>Website 2: Harry Potter/Georgia Tech Sorting Quiz</h2>
            <p>I created a "Buzz Feed" style form in CS 1301 that would ask questions about Georgia Tech related 
                things and sort the user into a Hogwarts house. I used different html form features and if statements to
                determine the house.

            <h2>AI Chatbot 1: BuzzBot</h2>
            <p> In a small group in LMC 2700, we created an AI Buzz themed chatbot with help from AI. The goal of BuzzBot is to help new students with
                questions about Georgia Tech. However, this iteration fell short with accuracy due to the lack of direct references.
                This was fixed in the Judicial AI project.

            <h2>AI Chatbot 2: Judicial AI </h2>
            <p> In a three person group with the help of AI in LMC 2700, we created a Judicial AI chatbot. The purpose is to
                speculate on a possible future of the legal system in the United States. The current iteration takes in files of
                United States general law, and gives advice based upon that information. It uses OpenAI to give accurate responses
                and communicate with the user.

            <h2>Video Game: Galactic Robotz</h2>
            <p>Using an online course in high school, I was able to design and partially program a platformer game
                in Unity. It utilizes enemies, collectables, and other platforming elements. It has some bug problems due
                to the hardware limitations I had at the time.

            <h2>Program: Atlanta Braves Lightsaber</h2>
            <p> The coding was light for this, only having to add in a prebuilt line of code to determine the color and
                timing. I converted videos and sound bites into .wav files to the specific kbps 
                needed by the lightsaber using DiVinci Resolve.
